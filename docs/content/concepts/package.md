# Packages

A package is similar to a Helm chart in that it is a source for Kubernetes resources that can make use of
templating to conditionally render resources and inject values into them. Resources generated by packages
may make use of Nyl-specific resource kinds that are only available time of resource generation (see the
[Templating > Resource Kinds](#resource-kinds) section below).

Nyl packages can be checked into a source repository in a DRY form, but can be compiled to a bundle (e.g.
including other referenced packages or Helm charts) for deployment when needed (e.g. for shipping to an
air-gapped environment).

Packages may have a `nyl-package.yaml` file that defines a schema for the package parameters and additional
metadata. A package without this file may still accept and use parameters in its templates.
